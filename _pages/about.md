Hi there! I'm a PhD student @ ASU working in the <a href="https://logos-robotics-lab.github.io/">Logos Robotics Lab</a> headed by <a href="https://nakulgopalan.github.io/">Dr. Nakul Gopalan</a>. My research focus is compositional robot learning, where I develop methods that leverage the principle of compositionality for robot manipulation.

In Fall 2025, I spent a semester at <a href="https://rai-inst.com/">RAI Institute</a> as a part of the **Compose** team, working on long horizon manipulation.

I completed my undergraduate and masterâ€™s degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Robotics at IIT Madras (India), where I worked with <a href="https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~amittal/">Dr. Anurag Mittal</a> for my master's thesis exploring the applications of capsule networks. Before starting my PhD, I spent 3 years at Wells Fargo where I did a variety of research in NLP.

Apart from my work, I enjoy hiking and have done several extensive hikes in the Himalayas and plan to do some more in the US! I have a strong liking for landscapes and nature.
