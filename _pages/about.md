Hi there! I'm a PhD student @ ASU working in the <a href="https://logos-robotics-lab.github.io/">Logos Robotics Lab</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://nakulgopalan.github.io/">Dr. Nakul Gopalan</a>. My main focus area is compositional robot learning, where I try to develop methods that utilize the principle of compositionality to learn skills efficiently. Prior to joining ASU, I worked for 3 years at Wells Fargo where I did a variety of research in NLP. In my previous life, I did my undergraduate and master's from IIT Madras (India), focusing on Robotics. My master's thesis was done under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~amittal/">Dr. Anurag Mittal</a>.

Apart from my work, I love hiking and have done several extensive hikes in the Himalayas and plan to do some more in the US! I have a strong liking for landscapes and nature.
