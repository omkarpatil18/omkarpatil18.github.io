  abstract={This paper surveys the current state of the art in document automation (DA). The objective of DA is to reduce the manual effort during the generation of documents by automatically integrating input from different sources and assembling documents conforming to defined templates. There have been reviews of commercial solutions of DA, particularly in the legal domain, but to date there has been no comprehensive review of the academic research on DA architectures and technologies. The current survey of DA reviews the academic literature and provides a clearer definition and characterization of DA and its features, identifies state-of-the-art DA architectures and technologies in academic research, and provides ideas that can lead to new research opportunities within the DA field in light of recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep neural networks.}

  abstract={Paraphrase generation is a difficult problem. This is not only because of the limitations in text generation capabilities but also due that to the lack of a proper definition of what qualifies as a paraphrase and corresponding metrics to measure how good it is. Metrics for evaluation of paraphrasing quality is an on going research problem. Most of the existing metrics in use having been borrowed from other tasks do not capture the complete essence of a good paraphrase, and often fail at borderline-cases. In this work, we propose a novel metric ROUGEP to measure the quality of paraphrases along the dimensions of adequacy, novelty and fluency. We also provide empirical evidence to show that the current natural language generation metrics are insufficient to measure these desired properties of a good paraphrase. We look at paraphrase model fine-tuning and generation from the lens of metrics to gain a deeper understanding of what it takes to generate and evaluate a good paraphrase.}

  abstract={Visual localization is the task of camera pose estimation, and is crucial for many technologies which involve localization such as mobile robots and augmented reality. Several convolutional neural network models have been proposed for the task against the more accurate geometry based computer vision techniques. However, they have several shortcomings and to our knowledge, this was the first effort that explored the use of an alternative architecture based on capsule-networks for the task. We achieved better results with capsules than with baseline-CNN PoseNet on small NORB dataset, modified for the task of camera pose estimation. Feature visualizations for both the networks produced more insights on their performance and behaviour. We found that there is a scope for improvement and hence propose few directions for future efforts.}

  abstract={Humans have the ability to perform various combinations of skills without having to relearn the overall resulting skill every single time. For example, we prefer to learn easy motions and then combine them in flexible ways to perform complicated movements in dance. Enabling robots to combine or compose skills is essential for their deployment in unstructured environments where they will be required to adapt based on their surroundings. Without such composition robots would have to learn a separate policy for each task which can be combinatorially expensive. To this end, we propose a compositional approach to blend different robot skills using diffusion models. We compose configuration-space diffusion policies for novel motion generation resulting from the corresponding skill combinations. We show that the compositional framework can be utilized to interpolate between different skills leading to greater flexibility in motion. By utilizing interpolation along with composition, we can not only constrain the motion but also generate novel trajectories. We also propose a novel metric based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy and the Forward Kinematics kernel: MMD-FK to quantitatively evaluate the composed robot motion in the task-space while remaining agnostic to the space of policy composition.}

  abstract={In this work, we present an approach to identify sub-tasks within a demonstrated robot trajectory with the supervision provided by language instructions. Learning longer horizon tasks is challenging with techniques such as reinforcement learning and behavior cloning. Previous approaches have split these long tasks into shorter tasks that are easier to learn by using statistical change point detection methods. However, classical changepoint detection methods function only with low dimensional robot trajectory data and not with high dimensional inputs such as vision. Our goal in this work is to split longer horizon tasks, represented by trajectories into shorter horizon tasks that can be learned using conventional behavior cloning approaches using guidance from language. In our approach we use techniques from the video moment retrieval problem on robot trajectory data to demonstrate a high-dimensional generalizable change-point detection approach. Our proposed moment retrieval-based approach shows a more than 30% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) for identifying trajectory sub-tasks with language guidance compared to that without language. We perform ablations to understand the effects of domain randomization, sample complexity, views, and sim-to-real transfer of our method. In our data ablation we find that just with a 100 labelled trajectories we can achieve a 61.41 mAP, demonstrating the sample efficiency of using such an approach. Further, behavior cloning models trained on our segmented trajectories outperform a single model trained on the whole trajectory by up to 20%.},

  abstract={This work consists of two main components: designing a hardware-software co-design, MT+, for adapting the Mikami-Tabuchi algorithm for on-board path planning by drones in a 3D environment; and development of a specialized custom hardware accelerator CDU, as a part of MT+, for parallel collision detection. Collision detection is a performance bottleneck in path planning. MT+ reduces the delay in path planning without using any heuristic. A comparative analysis between the state-of-the-art path planning algorithm A* and Mikami-Tabuchi is performed to show that Mikami-Tabuchi is faster than A* in typical real-world environments. In custom-generated environments, path planning using Mikami-Tabuchi shows a latency improvement of 1.7× across varying average sizes of obstacles and 2.7× across varying obstacle density over state-of-the-art path planning algorithm, A*. Further, the experiments show that the co-design achieves speedups over a full software implementation on CPU, averaging between 10% to 60% across different densities and sizes of obstacles. CDU area and power overheads are negligible against a conventional single-core processor.},

      abstract={Humans can perform various combinations of physical skills without having to relearn skills from scratch every single time. For example, we can swing a bat when walking without having to re-learn such a policy from scratch by composing the individual skills of walking and bat swinging. Enabling robots to combine or compose skills is essential so they can learn novel skills and tasks faster with fewer real world samples. To this end, we propose a novel compositional approach called DSE- Diffusion Score Equilibrium that enables few-shot learning for novel skills by utilizing a combination of base policy priors. Our method is based on probabilistically composing diffusion policies to better model the few-shot demonstration data-distribution than any individual policy. Our goal here is to learn robot motions few-shot and not necessarily goal oriented trajectories. Unfortunately we lack a general purpose metric to evaluate the error between a skill or motion and the provided demonstrations. Hence, we propose a probabilistic measure - Maximum Mean Discrepancy on the Forward Kinematics Kernel (MMD-FK), that is task and action space agnostic. By using our few-shot learning approach DSE, we show that we are able to achieve a reduction of over 30% in MMD-FK across skills and number of demonstrations. Moreover, we show the utility of our approach through real world experiments by teaching novel trajectories to a robot in 5 demonstrations.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
